This version is being submitted to fix archiving of this package. In addition, 
this is a re-submission of this same version fixing vignette building 
errors.

This is a new release. I have read and agree to the the CRAN
policies at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

This submissions changes how cache path is determined, and now asks
the user where to cache files when they use functions that use 
file caching (not all do). Examples and tests now use temp dirs.

Thanks! 
Scott Chamberlain
